    <h1>Pentakill</h1>
    <p>Fellow armsmen, I ask you, <br>
        Will you follow me tonight to break their spine,<br>
        And reclaim what once was mine?</p>
    <p>Those cravens. <br>
        Backstabbed me, deceived me, <br>
        Never shall I tolerate their crimes again,
        Now let the hunt begin.</p>
    <p>7000 souls, scared and daunted, such tale of woe,<br>
        Not too long ago, this village was a golden<br>
        scene of hope.</p>
